## What is it?
A "Hello, World!" program is a computer program that outputs or displays "Hello, World!" to a user. Being a very simple program in most programming languages, it is often used to illustrate the basic syntax of a programming language for a working program. It is often the very first program people write when they are new to a language.

## How it works?

~~~~
package demo 
 
fun main(args : Array<String>) { 
  println("Hello, world!") 
}

## What's next?

We plan on turning this solution into a microservice and also localizing "Hello World" into at least 40 languages. We see the future serving many clients who just want to say "[Hello](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDZcqBgCS74)".
